# Business-Analysis 
# **ACAB LIBRARY**

The Business Model Canvas (BMC) is a strategic planning and management tool used to illustrate, summarize, and develop new business models and documenting existing ones. It reflects systematically on your business model, so you can focus on it segment by segment.
Below is a BMC I created for a solution to a Business Information System problem during my journey to become a certified Business Analyst via the GT trainee program at @dataleum.
PS: The names City and ACAB are fictional.

## **PROBLEM STATEMENT**
The City library, located in the suburbs presently use the conventional library system which is the manual process of library operation where registered members need to visit the library physically, check the card catalog for books and get it from the shelf. The manual operation is cumbersome and less efficient because there are cases where members visit the library and the books are not available, some books are borrowed and are not returned as at when due thus causing books scarcity/unavailability.


# Existing Problems
Slow retrieval of data
Lack of information
Misplaced Library card

There is now a need for an automated system that will make the operation seamless in which users can have access to books directly from their homes or any location using their devices without having to physically visit the library.

# **SOLUTION OBJECTIVES**

ACAB has brought in the solution that is expected to develop a system where members from any location can do the following; 
- Members can login into the system from their mobile phone or any other device.
- Members can see the list of books available. 
- Members can search for books based on the author’s name or book title, publisher, publication and year.
- Members can read or download books online in form of e-books instead of going directly to the library.

The system will be able to send notification to members on due dates for borrowed books, availability of new books etc.
The job of the librarian is made easy as the entire process is automated.
The system will have a robust and up to date database.

# **MIND MAPPING**

Mind Mapping is the act of representing tasks, words, concepts, or items linked to and arranged around a central concept or subject using a non-linear graphical layout. It helps you build an intuitive framework around a central concept. A Mind Map can turn a long list of monotonous information into a colorful, memorable and highly organized diagram that works in line with your brain's natural way of doing things. It’s a logical way to 'map out' your ideas.
It can be used for;
•	Brainstorming and visualizing concepts
•	Presenting and communicating ideas
•	Graphic organizers and electronic note books
•	Running meetings more effectively
•	Outlining reports and documents
•	Simplifying task and project management

After creating the Business Model Canvas for ACAB library, I went on to create a mind map that reflects the flow of information that the Business Information system is expected to carry out when acted upon by an actor.
P.S: In a business scenario, an actor represents anything that interacts with or within the system. This can be a human, or a machine, or a computer program. Actors initiate activity with the system; for example: A computer user with the computer or a phone user with the phone.
